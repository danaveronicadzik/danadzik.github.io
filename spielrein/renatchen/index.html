<h1>Renatchen's Theory of Human Origin</h1>
<p>The first theory of human origin that I noticed from Renachten came about when she was four and a half years old. I do not mean to say that the young girl did not previously have other theories, but she doesn’t reveal any. During the long preliminary stage of analysis, the child allowed much to be perceived that could show the analyst she had dealt with this topic extensively. The young girl showed a keen interest in holes and pits; the stories she made up dealt with this topic, and her play was inspired by this interest. She found great pleasure in digging in the ground, and she very much wanted to remove a board from the flooring such that there would be a hole through which one could fall into the neighbors’ residence; presumably this was also a case of her great predilection for cutting out [Ausschneiden]. Scarcely after waking, she wanted to have scissors and paper; she then remained tranquil for hours, jabbering to herself, only exciting my disapproval by cutting holes in her bedding and clothing, or be gleefully tearing everything apart. As another bad habit, in her fourth year she became accustomed to throwing down and breaking [Hinauswerfen und Zerbrechen] things. One day we had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Renatchen: Mama, if Renatchen fell here – what would happen then? (Qu'est ce que cela aurait donné?)<br>
Me: You could hurt yourself severely.<br>
Renatchen: No, what could then come about?<br>
Me: Renatchen could be broken to pieces [zerschlagen].<br>
Renatchen (feistily): No, no! Then two Renatchens would come into being. And what if both of these Renatchens fell? What would come about then?<br>
Me: Then from both of these Renatchens would come about a pair of Renatchens.<br>
Renatchen: And what would come about when each of these of these pairs of Renatchens fell again?<br>
Me: Then from every Renatchen two Renatchens would come about.<br>
Renatchen: So this would bring about many, many Renatchens!</p>
<p>Now we can understand the child’s predilections and vices. She had searched for an explanation of her genesis long before speaking of it. She instinctively worked out the old symbolism of ditchdigging; at the same time, she tore at (cut up) everything because she wanted to have many “Renatchens”; throwing down and breaking [Hinauswerfen und Zerbrechen] things had this same meaning. “Instinctively” the child had formed an theory of origination corresponding to the theory of reproduction actually attaining to lower beings. As was to be expected, the child was shortly dissatisfied with this theory; she formulated a great number of increasingly clear questions, so around her fifth year I professed to her that the child in the mother was made from an oak tree into which the father added his “grain.” I did not want to give further details. After that, Renatchen formed a “cannibalistic” theory of insemination and conception. One day she said to me: “Mama, swallow me whole; then you will be killed and I will come out of you.” This fantasy also comprehends the natural daughterly emotions of vengefulness towards the mother (in my killing), the negative side of the love for the mother, whom the young girl constantly apprehends as a rival to be replaced, even in the absence of the father. She asked me several times why the little girl was born in the mother and not vice versa, the birth of the mother in the little girl. In these days she opined: “I want the mother to die (from whom?), no – I want her to neither live nor die; I want her to again become a little girl.” Insofar as my observations have yielded, she always thinks of death as a return to the origin = rebirth = the act of fertilization. Another token of this is that we think of the genesis of the soul and ceasing to exist to be qualitatively similar. What today we find displeasurable will tomorrow be pleasurable, and indeed this is in accordance with Bleuler’s Principle of Ambivalence.</p>
